There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Basketball Viz

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  Vizualized stats for the avid NBA fan.
## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Find any NBA player in any NBA season and get vizualized data of shot charts, assist graphs, rebounding percentages, and more.  Find out which areas on the court Stephen Curry lights it up and which areas he struggles with.  Find out how Chris Paul's assists are distributed among his teammates.  Find out the shooting percentages of opponents against Rudy Gobert.  Basketball Viz queries the NBA database with each request so will always get the most recent, up-to-date stats.
## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Major basketball sites are either outdated (Yahoo) or filled with ads and videos (ESPN).  Sites that offer visualization of data are not up-to-date and usually are associated with an article on a particular player or team.  Avid fans such as myself often find the box score lacking.
## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Basketball Viz provides an app that is clean and easy to use.  It sends requests to NBA.com for up to date stats and will use Angular to dynamically update the one-page app.
## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "Basketball Viz is the new way to assess the skill level of a player, a dynamic and vizual way to look at stats, and a perfect tool for curious fans who find the normal box score lacking or for prospects who want to imitate their favorite players."
## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Just go to the web app, type in a player name (any player who has ever played in the NBA), select a season, select a stat type, and hit submit.
## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "Basketball Viz is a great way to track my favorite players and see how they perform on the court.  It's also great for going back in time and seeing how Jordan's shot chart compares to Lebron's."
## Closing and Call to Action ##
